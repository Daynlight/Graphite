## About
Graphite is simple 2D/3D math visual app like geogebra, desoms, amtplotlib in python. It works on c++ scripting language. It is based how scripts works via using interfaces and dll loading. Allows how swap dll on runtime for easy and nice experience. It uses my own rendering library [CWindow](https://github.com/daynlight/CWindow)

Why it exists:
  * I hate python
  * Geogebra is slow
  * I love my own software
  * Learning

For who it is:
  * For people that want faster graphical math app
  * People who hate python <3
